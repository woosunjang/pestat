# pestat.py

Python script to mimic [pestat](https://github.com/OleHolmNielsen/Slurm_tools/tree/master/pestat), for easy inspection of node and job status in HPC cluster.

The script is not so tidy, since it is developed for the personal use.
 
However, it is open-sourced under GNU GPL v3, so others can still use and modify the script.
